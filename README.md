We are presenting this “Cracking Blackjack” repository, as a way of consolidating the knowledge we have gained in our Reinforcement Learning class in the University of Chicago. We combined the info of 30+ articles and blog posts when were creating this Blackjack project. 
We are Covering following algorithms in the repository:
1. Monte Carlo Simulation using stochastic & discrete policies
2. Simulation of average reward per round using the OpenAI gym template
3. Custom development on OpenAI gym template using First Visit Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation, to improve the average reward per round

Happy Coding!
